An psudo-anonymus content discussion site based on Django and React.js.

##psudo-anonymus
Users can sign up without an email address but in case of lossing password there will be no way to recover. Though provided the email is given the account will recoverable. On the more important note, users will not be explicitly asked to provide their real name at any point. They can chose any handle(username) they wish on condition of availability. 

##Ranking
Users will be ranked on their interactions. For meaningful discussion and contribution to the community. Ranking will explicitly be shown on the profile. Also features and contents can be made available on the basis of the ranking. The philosophy is your deeds talks more about you than your claims. 

##Notification
Notifications will be minimum and timely. All notfications will be delivered at a fixed time, fixed by the user. Though on demand notfications will also be available. This is to bar trigger happy interactions and prompting a healthy online presence. Come at your own convenience, not whenever your phone dings. 
We believe this will solve two important problem with our present social media regimes; first, no rush to engage; second, meaningful discussion. 
Again notifications will be made if explicitly asked for to follow a discussion, and if the discussion seems engaging from other users interactions. If we are to discuss important issues we better have a long attention span.
